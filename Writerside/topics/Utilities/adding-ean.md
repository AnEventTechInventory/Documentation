# Adding ean to a type

## Introduction

At any point a EAN, GTIN or similar can be added to a type. This can be done by hand or by scanning a barcode. This 
can be used to create new [devices](device.md) from the ean or scan to get all devices of the same [type](type.md). 

The idea is that if you have devices which you have to replace regularly, you can simply scan the barcode on the 
packaging and create a new device.
